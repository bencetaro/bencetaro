### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my github page. Below you can see my programming journey so far: ðŸ¤–
- 2017: Learned C++ as first programming language
- 2018: Switched to Python for GIS application development
- 2019: Made my diploma work about DL and Object Detection
- 2020-2023: Working as a GIS analyst. Also doing work in SQL, Python. Made some machine learning projects and learned a lot more about statistics.
- 2023: Tensorflow Developer Certificate âš¡ [link](https://www.credential.net/2fe2aedd-a7a7-43d9-bc19-767565c33a04)
- 2024: Working as ML developer
- 2025: Finished my studies in ELTE as *Mathematics expert in data analytics and machine learning* ðŸŽ“
