### Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub page, where I share my programming journey and Data Science projects. Here is a snapshot of my work over the past few years:
- 2017: Learned C++ as first programming language.
- 2018: Switched to Python for GIS application development and spatial data analysis.
- 2019: Completed my thesis on Object Detection, which was my first real deep learning project.
- 2020-2023: Started working in a GIS analyst role, where I applied my SQL and Python skills. I also created some machine learning projects and expanded my statistical knowledge.
- 2023: Earned the Tensorflow Developer Certification ⚡ [link](https://www.credential.net/2fe2aedd-a7a7-43d9-bc19-767565c33a04)
- 2024: Started working as a ML engineer.
- 2025: Graduated from ELTE as *Mathematics expert in data analytics and machine learning.* 🎓
